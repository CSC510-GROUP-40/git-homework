# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We are committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment for all contributors. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all participants in the project and describes steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language.
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
Focusing on what is best for the community.
Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
Public or private harassment.
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project team at [
himohamm@ncsu.edu, 
larkoh@ncsu.edu, lliu39@ncsu.edu]. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team, who will review and investigate the situation. The project team has the right and responsibility to remove comments, commits, code, issues, or other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
